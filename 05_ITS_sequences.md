# Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) queries

The rRNA subunits are co-transcribed as a single polycistronic precursor, the 35S rRNA, containing three rRNA species (18S, 5.8S, and 25S), as well as internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) that will be removed during the maturation process.

To screen RNA-Seq data from contaminants, we want to used only ITS belonging to complete 35S transcripts. We will frist identify full 35S units, and then subtract 18S, 5.8S, and 25S.
